# Assignment 3


### 1. **BMI Calculator**
Write a Python program that asks the user for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), and then calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI). Use the formula:
```shell
BMI = Weight / (Height ** 2)
```
Then classify the BMI result according to the following categories:

- BMI < 18.5: Underweight
- 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9: Normal weight
- 25.0 ≤ BMI < 29.9: Overweight
- BMI ≥ 30: Obesity

#### Example: 
```python
# Input: weight = 70, height = 1.75
# Output: 
# BMI: 22.86
# Category: Normal weight
```

### 2. **Currency Converter**
Write a Python program that converts a given amount of money in US dollars (USD) to another currency (e.g., Euros). The program should take the amount in USD and the exchange rate as inputs.
#### Example:
```python
# Input: amount_in_usd = 100, exchange_rate = 0.85
# Output: 
# Amount in EUR: 85.00
```

### 3. **Simple Interest Calculator**
Write a Python program that calculates the simple interest using the formula
```bash
Interest =  (Principal*Rate*Time)/100
```

#### Example:
```python
# Input: principal = 1000, rate = 5, time = 2
# Output: 
# Simple Interest: 100.0
```
